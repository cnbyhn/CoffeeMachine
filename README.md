# CoffeeMachine
The Coffee Project simulates a coffee machine where users can choose from a menu of drinks (e.g., latte, espresso, cappuccino), insert coins to pay for their drinks, and check available resources like water, milk, and coffee. The program manages the menu, processes payments, and makes coffee, ensuring that the machine has enough ingredients before preparing the chosen drink.
